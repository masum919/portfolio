**2. Design and analysis of wire-driven robotic joints with applications for Minimally Invasive Surgeries** <br />
   This project was aimed to eliminate two major problems associated with Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS): (1) Damage to on-site motors and sensors of surgical robots (2) Lack of multifunctionality 
   or accommodating mulitple surgial tools in a confined space. To resolve these two issues I designed and developed a wire actuation system that enables remote placement of electronics and motors as well as 
   enable multifunctionality.

- Designed wire actuation for different types of robotic joints 
- Developed a surgical multi-functional robotic tool manipulator
- Improved surgical tool changing time 30%
- Implemented a PID position control scheme for the tool manipulation

**3. Design and development of a robotic landing system for UAVs** <br />
   This project focused on building a self adjusting landing gear for UAVs for safe landing in uneven terrains.

- Designed a mechanical self-adjustic robotic landing gear mechanism 

**4. An active orthosis with Tenodesis Effect for pinch force augmentation in activities of daily living** <br />
     In this work, I had developed an inexpensive and simple orthosis to augment pinch grasp force for Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) patients with Tenodesis Effect. The orthosis was made to operate in both passive 
     and active mode. It had only one motor (MAXON DC) and no sensor. Most of the parts were 3D printed.

- Developed an active robotic orthosis for spinal cord injury patients 
- Reduced cost by eliminating need for any sensors and using only one motor 
- Performed kinematics and stress analysis to ensure safety 

**5. Development of micro-robotic systems for surgical treatment of chronic total occlusion** <br />
     I have built a FEM simulation model of an 8-core Electromagnetic Actuation System (EAS) with ANSYS MAXWELL. I have also simulated and analyzed the magnetic fields produced by the system to verify the real 
     system for microrobot manipulations.

- Developed a simulation model for an 8 core Electromagnetic Actuation System 
- Validated and analyzed magnetic field distributions with ANSYS MAXWELL
